WordPress theme Adams v6 urgent compatibility fix for WordPress v5.8

Dear Precious Clients,

This is a temp fix for Adams v6.x to work with WordPress v5.8 until the next update released,

1. Download from Green button [Code] then [Download ZIP] 

2. Uncompress

3. NOTE: DO NOT Replace the directories, Just files inside.

4. Replace file [footer-scripts.js] in [THEME_DIR / js] dir.

5. Replaces files [jquery.maskedinput-1.2.2.js] and [smof.js] in [THEME_DIR / admin / assets / js]

Thanks for your patience,

A huge update coming very soon.
